# Linear Regression Analysis

This repository contains Python code for performing linear regression analysis on a dataset. 
The analysis includes tasks such as plotting a bar chart, identifying and removing outliers, building a regression model, 
calculating mean score at 95% confidence interval, and comparing real and predicted weights.

## Files

- `ML Class Assessment 3.py`: Python script containing the code for linear regression analysis.
- `Fish_dataset.csv`: Sample dataset file used for analysis. Replace with your own dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
